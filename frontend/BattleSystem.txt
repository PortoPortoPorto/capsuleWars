Notes on the Battle System

GENERAL

	* 6 on 6 battles on a 16w x 11h grid (subject to change) 

	* Turn order determined at start of each round. Units sorted by speed, then randomly ordered at each matching speed level. 


DISPLAY

	* GridMap.jsx -> Battle area with units, tiles, obstacles, movement, combat etc

	* UiTop.jsx -> Display turn order. Resets after each round.

	* UiLeft.jsx -> Display current unit statistics, statuses, img and special abilities (which are selected here).

	* UiRight.jsx -> Display hovered unit statistics, statuses, img and abilities.

	* UiBtm.jsx -> Display combat / special move preview, inc % of hit, amount of Dmg, effects etc. 


TURNS

	* Unit is automatically selected once their turn begins, and is displayed in UiLeft.jsx.

	* Unit can move once and use an attack/ability/end turn once.

	* Movement may come before or after action, but never both. (unless unit has special ability). 

	* When turn ends, unit is removed from the turn order array until the beginning of the next round.

	* Special abilites cost BP, and are selected from UiLeft.jsx.

	* Movement and attack abilities are inititated in Gridmap.jsx, and are indicated by different cursors. 


DESTROYING UNITS

	* When a unit's HP is 0, they die and are rendered as a corpse. 

	* Units can be revived by certain abilities, but these are rare.

	* Necromancy effects can turn dead units into skeletons. 


VICTORY CONDITIONS

	* Player must eliminate all units on other side, or opponent must concede.
